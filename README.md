# davis creator tools

A set of utilities I need/use every day for content creation

- svg => png converter
- svg background adder
- background remover
- library of thumbnail faces/assets
- **more to be added as I need them**

_still deciding if I want this to be paid or not_ currently thinking I open source it, if you want to use it self hosted, go crazy. If not, I'll have a paid version that has background removal, asset storage, raycast extension, etc.
